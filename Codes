'Build the program!
' 1. Create ingredients
' 2. Create iteration loop/loop through each Row
    '2.a  does VBA already know how to loop through the rows? Do i need to establish rows too?
        '2.aa repeat the loop 753001 times as per the worksheet length
' 3. Create calculator
    ' 3.a calculate yearly change
    ' 3.b calculate percent change
    ' 3.c calculate Total Stock Volume
' 4. Create the results table
    '3.a Color the yearly change to be ABOVE ZERO = GREEN

        
'Create entire loop
Sub Stock_data()

'Loop through all sheets
For Each ws In Worksheets
' STEP 1: Make different variables for the Data Math
    'learn to set up EACH VARIABLE AS ITS OWN.
